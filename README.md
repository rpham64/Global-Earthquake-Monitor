# Global-Earthquake-Monitor

**Global Earthquake Monitor** is an interactive world map developed in Java for visualizing real-time earthquake data. Users can
use the application to determine where the latest earthquakes took place, how intense they were by their marker sizes, whether
they occured on land or in ocean, and which major cities were affected.

This project was created as part of UCSD's Coursera class "Object Oriented Programming in Java", course 1 of their "Java Programming:
Object Oriented Design of Data Structures Specialization" curriculum. The code and files in this repository include my implementations
for their class' project.
